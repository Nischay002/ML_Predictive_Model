# ML_Predictive_Model
This project demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression from scratch using Python. Instead of relying on libraries like sklearn, this project builds the predictive model step by step, covering:

âœ… Data Preprocessing
âœ… Feature Selection
âœ… Mathematical Formulation of Linear Regression
âœ… Model Training using Gradient Descent
âœ… Model Evaluation with Performance Metrics

Technologies Used
	â€¢	Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
	â€¢	Machine Learning Concepts (Gradient Descent, Loss Function, Predictions)

Key Highlights

ðŸ”¹ No pre-built ML librariesâ€”everything coded from scratch!
ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step explanation of the regression process.
ðŸ”¹ Visualizations for better understanding.
