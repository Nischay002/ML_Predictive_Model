# ML_Predictive_Model
A Machine Learning project implementing Multiple Linear Regression using Python (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib). This model predicts numerical outcomes based on input features by leveraging data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation (RÂ² Score, MSE).

Features

âœ… Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
âœ… Model Training using scikit-learn
âœ… Performance Evaluation with RÂ² Score & MSE
âœ… Data Visualization using Matplotlib

Technologies Used
â€¢	Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
â€¢	Machine Learning Concepts (Gradient Descent, Loss Function, Predictions)

Key Highlights

ðŸ”¹ No pre-built ML librariesâ€”everything coded from scratch!
ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step explanation of the regression process.
ðŸ”¹ Visualizations for better understanding.
