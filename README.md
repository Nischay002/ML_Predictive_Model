# ML_Predictive_Model
This Machine Learning project demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using Python and scikit-learn to build a predictive model for numerical forecasting. It covers:

âœ… Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
âœ… Feature Selection (Identifying the most relevant predictors)
âœ… Mathematical Understanding of Linear Regression
âœ… Model Training using scikit-learn
âœ… Performance Evaluation with RÂ² Score & Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Technologies Used
	â€¢	Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	â€¢	Machine Learning with scikit-learn
	â€¢	Data Visualization & Insights

Key Highlights
